    <h1>Sorry, Silicon Valley Won’t Save Your <br> Kids From Tech Addiction</h1>
    <p>We asked hundreds of parents how they manage (and don’t manage) their kids’ screen time. <br> The answers were candid, scary–and sometimes hopeful.</p>

        <p>“I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as is my husband. It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies. Not wanting to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, holds it in his hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone. It is the cutest/most pathetic thing.”</p>
        <p>That’s the eerie image a New York mom of two paints of her small child’s burgeoning tech addiction. Like most parents, that mom lives a waking life seeped in almost non-stop screen time (an average American adult spends about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/30/health/americans-screen-time-nielsen/index.html">11 hours a day looking at a screen</a>). She, like many modern parents, sees her own tech dependency reflected in her children’s habits. She doesn’t always like what she sees.</p>
        <p>Even as we learn about the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40520843/silicon-valley-technology-regulate-gadgets-and-apps-like-cigarettes">potential pitfalls</a> of our increasingly technology-addled lifestyles, our dependence on tech shows little sign of waning. Still, the anti-screen time drumbeat is getting louder, especially when it comes to kids.</p>
        <p>In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early employee at Facebook, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40506058/former-facebook-exec-social-media-is-ripping-apart-society">said that the social network was “ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.”</a> Tristan Harris, a former product manager at Google, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/">told Wired</a> that Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram design products to “hijack” our time and attention. In January, two Apple investors asked the company to study the health effects of its products on children.</p>
        <p>Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former employees from some the most powerful tech companies–including Apple, Google, and Facebook–formed the <a href="http://humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology.</a> In partnership with the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, the group plans to lobby against addictive tech, and is kicking off with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40526553/truth-about-tech-campaign-aims-to-pressure-tech-giants-to-make-less-addictive-products">a $7 million “Truth about Tech” ad campaign</a> that they plan to deliver to 55,000 public schools.</p>

        <p>That the very people who championed the technology to which we are addicted are now banding together to warn parents about the monster they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are starting to question tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad campaign, no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail our society’s addiction–especially when kids these days are being introduced to screens at such a young age. In her book, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=122276X1583643&xs=1&isjs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FArt-Screen-Time-Balance-Digital%2Fdp%2F1610396723&xguid=a1431ef946fdd3a19b1ed59a3bbc5562&xuuid=afa98682a395b497638c9e5b2dc3c503&xsessid=&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F40543266%2Fsorry-silicon-valley-wont-save-your-kids-from-tech-addiction&pref=http%3A%2F%2Flifechoices.codespace.co.za%2Fcourse%2F57%2Fmodule%2F31%2Flesson%2F356%2Fview&xtz=-120&jv=13.12.1-stackpath&bv=2.5.1">The Art of Screen Time</a> Anya Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds) that found that young kids spend about four hours a day in the company of (all types of) screens.</p>
        <p>To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast Company surveyed nearly 400 parents. We tried to look at the issue from all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types of devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of technology, to the benefits that technology can provide to families. We also asked parents how they feel about witnessing their own tech addiction reflected in their kids’ behavior. Those were, perhaps, the most telling answers of all.</p>
        <p>The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a few other countries). Their professions span many industries, including marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, video production, law, medicine, and business. Most participants have one or two children, ranging from 7 months to 18 years old. The majority of participants’ kids are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words, these parents are in the thick of parenting.</p>
        <p>Obviously, this self-selected group of Fast Company readers isn’t a conclusive sample–but, along with expert research, these parents’ insights help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden parents in our tech-dependent era.</p>

        <!-- <h3>DO SCREENS MAKE KIDS LESS SOCIAL AND LESS CREATIVE?</h3>
        <p>Even if it involves lots of virtual interaction via social networks and texting, using a screen can be a pretty solo activity. Using smartphones, tablets, and even computers aren’t generally as communal as watching a TV with your family.</p>
    <hr>
        <p><strong>Related:</strong><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3057032/a-smarter-way-to-think-about-screen-time-and-kids-tech-use"> A Smarter Way To Think About “Screen Time” And Kids’ Tech Use</a></p>

        <p>
            TV has been around a long time. For many of us, it is the devil we know and, unlike other screened devices, it’s arguably easier for parents to know what their children are watching on TV than it is for parents to know what their kids are looking at on the internet. In fact, as crazy as it might sound, we’ve reached a point where some parents actually wish their kids were watching more TV.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I would love them to watch TV, at least it is more social since they will watch it with their siblings or friends! I never thought I would ever be encouraging this, but [watching TV] is much better than being locked in your own room with your own iPhone having an isolated life,” wrote a London dad of three.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, many of our readers told us that they feel that tech has squashed their kids’ creativity–and turned them into little monsters.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I purchased a tablet for my oldest child at the age of 9. She stopped using her imagination, she very abruptly stopped drawing, and very quickly it became a daily battle to limit her time on the tablet,” wrote an environmental biologist from Pennsylvania who has three kids.
        </p>

        <p>
            A dad and executive from Chicago, also with three kids, interprets it this way: “[The] smartphone takes over a child’s daily consciousness. Natural[ly] voracious, inquisitive curiosity seekers slowly, invariably, and inevitably become young people indifferent to discovery in favor of scrolling. Smartphones numb creativity, intellectual critical thought, and social growth.”

        <h3>BEING A ROLE MODEL IS SCARY</h3>
        <p>
            A lot of parenting can be a battle of “do what I say, not what I do”–and nowhere is this more evident than in parents’ use of tech. Many parents in our survey said their device dependency makes them feel like hypocrites when they try to limit their kids’ tech use. “My main regret is how much we use phones in front of them,” wrote a mom of two from Minnesota who doesn’t allow any screen time for her two young children.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I see myself reaching for my phone out of habit anytime I’m the least bit bored or have a moment to spare. I hate this, and yet can’t seem to stop myself. I figure at least my brain patterns were formed without this influence and am terrified of what growing up with smartphones and tech will do to my daughter,” wrote a New York City mom of a 1-year-old.
        </p>

        <p>
            When kids get older, they relish calling their parents out on that hypocrisy. “Some apps and games can become a part of your life and routines to the point where they become an obsession. My kids call me out for being on my phone too much, and I have to pull myself out of it and show them how you can set limits with yourself and be present with the people in your life,” wrote a psychologist and New York mom of three.
       </p>

       <p>
            “I asked my kids what they thought about smartphones. They said that they must be really important, because the adults looked at their screens all the time, and based on how frustrated adults got when kids interrupted them, they assumed the phones were more important than them, which was heartbreakingly sad to hear,” wrote an engineer and mom of two from New Hampshire. 
       </p>

       <p>
            Many parents who answered our survey said that having kids forced them to look more critically at how they use technology and caused these parents to make a conscious effort to change. “My wife and I have now made a pledge for complete ‘phone-free’ activity for ourselves from the time we arrive home from work until the children go to bed–no scrolling social media, no email checking,” wrote a Chicago dad of three.

        <h3>PARENTS ARE WORRIED ABOUT ADDICTION</h3>

        <p>
            With a lack of solid national data on the effects of all this tech exposure on kids, parents definitely have a lot of concerns. In our unscientific survey, only a blissed out 1% of parents expressed no concerns about their kids’ use of tech.
       </p>

       <p>
            For the rest of our participants, nearly everyone (over 80%) communicated concern about their kids becoming addicted and developing a shortened attention span (likely because the parents are experiencing these problems themselves). In our survey, addiction appears to trump the traditional things we were told to fear on the internet, like sexual predators and online bullying, which only concerned about half of parents who took part in our survey. And data privacy is only a concern for a little more than half of parents who took part in our questionnaire.
        </p>

        <p>
            “It’s definitely addictive behavior. And behavioral change is real. Wonder what damage was done during a more permissive period that we can’t now undo,” wrote a mom of two from Massachusetts of kids’ device habits.
        </p>

        <p>
            A New York mom of two describes the compulsive behavior she witnesses in her daughter. “Monitoring screen time is exhausting and virtually impossible. My 12-year-old daughter checks her phone constantly; she doesn’t even know she’s doing it.”
       </p>

        <p>
            These parents’ concerns are backed up by research. A 2016 survey from Common Sense Media found that 78% of teenagers check their devices at least hourly, and half said that they thought they were addicted to their phones. There is a lot of debate, however, over whether it is possible to truly be addicted, in the clinical sense, to technology.
