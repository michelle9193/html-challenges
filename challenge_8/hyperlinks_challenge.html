            <p style="padding: 0 150px; text-align: center">
                I have learned all the basics of HTML. I know about tags, inputs, forms and tables. I was given challenges that I needed to complete which improved my HTML capailities. One of the primary features of the HTML language is its use of tags to style text and other visual elements. HTML is used to define the general layout and look of a webpage. You can define what type of text you want to include, you can make tables and lists, and you can embed things like images and videos. It makes it simple to create engaging content in a way that web browsers can understand, and that it is simple to learn and easy to use.
